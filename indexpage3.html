                            Only 25% of U.S. public high school graduates have the skills needed to succeed academically in college. In a November 2015 mock project, <a href="http://designation.io/">DESIGNATION</a> wanted an online platform that would help students improve their chances for success in college.</p>

                        With the overwhelmingly positive response from students, I’d love to continue building functionality into the website and adding to the available content.

                        <em>Going into this project, I had firsthand experience with designing college-readiness programming in the physical space and was excited to be tasked with designing a digital product for the same cause. I made sure to assume a beginner’s mindset and used this opportunity to truly shift perspectives, take my bias out of the design process, and make sure I was designing for the user. This experience solidified my focus on channeling key insights based on research data into my user-centered design process.</em></p>
