                        Savvo is an integrated marketing company with interactive food and wine pairing displays in grocery stores. With low shopper usage, limited data on user engagement, and a business goal to scale into a large regional chain, Savvo sought a kiosk redesign.</p>

We collectively agreed to also incorporate the visual descriptors and the trimmed-down version of the content into building mid-fidelity wireframes of the final prototype.</p>

To avoid a “Frankenstein” situation, we collectively sketched the layout of our chosen screens into a flow, and then agreed on a style tile of fonts and colors before designing our mid-fidelity wireframes in Illustrator. </p>

                        <p class="norm text-justify">I designed the full and split-view screens, created icons for image placeholders, and compiled all screens for a final review. While my partner compiled the final prototypes, I worked on annotating the wireframes for Savvo.</p>

                        Our client was impressed with the research insights and redesigned interface. Our work contributed to the company’s decision of halting their growth plans to start off fresh with a complete redesign of both the interface screen and kiosk display using our suggestions. Our wireframes have been passed along to user interface designers as of February 2016 so we’re excited to see the redesigned kiosks deployed in the next few weeks.</p>

                        Going into this project, I was excited to dabble in service design and improve the interaction between grocery shoppers and the kiosk display by taking a holistic approach. I learned how much I enjoy helping to make products more usable and also how I can successfully tackle new domains with the help of design-thinking research. It solidified my transition from being a customer-advocate to a user-centered designer. If I could do anything differently, it would have more access to grocery shoppers at the store and maybe usability “taste” the wine and cheese myself. </em></p>
