                        <p class="norm text-justify">Our clients were impressed with each of our concepts so we took that feedback along with our testing insights to create one mid-fidelity wireframe that encompassed all of our strongest design elements. Focusing on the needs of our personas and their contexts helped us decide what would make it to the final design: 

                            <ul>
                            <li>Live mode – when device is “in-use”, this mode allows unobtrusive impact monitoring of hits above an athlete’s custom threshold</li>
                            <li>Customizable threshold: unique g-force setting for each athlete 
                            <li>Shareability function - allows continuity in paper keeping among systems</li>
                            <li>Team Dashboard - player roster, athlete profile, impact profile, notes</li>
                            <li>Impact Profile - details impact history with an ability to replay the hit</li>
                            </ul>

                        </p>

                        <p class="norm text-justify">With my live mode feature selected, I focused on refining those screens to flow with the rest of the app. To help, I created a quick app map so that we could set the information architecture and navigational flow of how each screen connected before building our mid-fidelity screens.</p>

                        <p class="norm text-justify">When it came to refining our deliverables, I lead the final review of all of our screens and created the iconography in Illustrator, while my colleagues annotated our wireframes and built the final interactive prototype.</p>

                        Our client was impressed with the depth of our research insights and how the data was visualized in our final mobile app design. By helping Curious Technologies identify their key users and empathize with stakeholders’ sideline assessment needs, the device was able to incorporate features that the product engineers wouldn’t have known to include without our user research. Our wireframes were used by user interface designers to finish the mobile app that is currently being built by iOS developers.</p>

                        <em>I was excited to dabble in interaction design and work on potentially the next big thing in wearable technology. I learned how to breakdown and prioritize complex data sets to help end users make sense of what’s most important in a seamless way. For future projects, I will only get more efficient at learning new/unfamiliar technologies and domains to help me design their digital counterparts. I’m impressed with how much was accomplished in just 3 weeks and this project helped me hone user-centered design principles in my process-driven way of solving problems.</em></p>
