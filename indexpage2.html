                        Curious Technologies was inventing a smart-connected device to detect head impacts and potential concussions in youth football players. As their first product idea to use new <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wearables/wearable-soc.html">wearable device technology</a>, Curious Technologies sought a mobile app design from <a href="http://designation.io/">DESIGNATION</a> in December 2015.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Challenge</h4>

                        In a team of 2 UX designers, we had <strong>3 weeks and no financial budget</strong>  to identify the device’s key users and design an accompanying iOS mobile app.</p>

                        We met to exchange feedback on our ideas and each pursued our strongest concepts to build low-fidelity prototypes.

                    We tested the prototype with 4 athletic trainers and the response was great. They thought the app had everything they needed to supplement their sideline assessments and they considered learning more about g-force to complement their current knowledge.

                        Our client was impressed with the depth of our research insights and how data was visualized in our mobile app design. By helping Curious Technologies identify their key users and empathize with their sideline assessment needs, the device was able to incorporate features Our wireframes were passed along to a team of user interface designers who I consulted with to carry out our designs for iOS developers.</p>

                        <em>Going into this project, I was excited to dabble in service design and improve the interaction between grocery shoppers and the kiosk display by taking a holistic approach to problem solving. I learned how much I enjoy helping to make products more usable and also how I can successfully tackle new domains with the help of design-thinking research. If I could do anything differently, it would be to have more access to grocery shoppers at the store and maybe usability “taste” the wine and cheese myself. I’m impressed by how much was accomplished in just 3 weeks and this project helped solidify my transition from being a customer-advocate to a user-centered designer.</em><br>
                    In the future, I’d want to spend more time understanding the product’s capabilities once the engineers finish building it and also get access to even more users to test assumptions and explore concepts further. Next big thing in wearables and smart-connected devices</p>
